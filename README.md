Feature	Platform Threads	Virtual Threads
Thread Creation	Heavy, OS-managed, high overhead	Lightweight, JVM-managed, low overhead
Context Switching	Expensive, involves OS scheduler	Fast, managed by JVM (no OS involvement)
Memory Consumption	High (2MB+ stack per thread)	Low (few KB per thread)
Blocking Calls	Blocks OS thread, inefficient for I/O	Does not block carrier thread, better for I/O-bound tasks
Concurrency	Limited by system threads (~1000s)	Millions of threads possible
Best Use Case	CPU-bound tasks	I/O-bound, high-concurrency workloads

Expected Performance Results
Threads	Platform Threads (ms)	Virtual Threads (ms)
1,000	~500 ms	~100 ms
10,000	~5000 ms	~200 ms
100,000	‚ùå (out of memory)	~500 ms


 Observations:

Platform Threads struggle with high concurrency due to memory and context-switching overhead.
Virtual Threads can handle 100,000+ tasks efficiently as they don't block OS threads.
Conclusion
‚úÖ Use Platform Threads for CPU-intensive computations (e.g., matrix multiplications, data processing).
‚úÖ Use Virtual Threads for I/O-heavy tasks (e.g., web servers, database queries, network calls).

I'll extend the analysis with a detailed comparison across different workloads:

CPU-Intensive Tasks (e.g., Mathematical Computations)
I/O-Bound Tasks (e.g., Database or Network Calls)
Mixed Workloads (Combination of CPU & I/O)
